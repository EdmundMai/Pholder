				<p>Pholder is a platform to bring together pictures taken by different individuals into one accessible place, making it convenient to view and share images with your friends and colleagues.</p> <br>

				<p>Simply put, no longer will you have to individually search and download your friends' pictures from last week's party or yesterday's hiking trip. Pholder makes it easy for its users to distribute hundreds of pictures through a simple invite, upload, and download system. You create an album, invite friends to share access to this album, and then freely share each other's pictures all through one folder.</p> <br>

				<p>Pholder is also useful for those who want to share project creations. If you're working in a group and have to share your individual pieces of work, Pholder is a great tool to coordinate and examine your group's progress. You can upload your picture in seconds and your group member can view and comment on your work straight from his/her phone/computer without ever downloading anything.</p> <br>
				<p>You can view multiple images at a time or go through them one by one. You can also filter by name and date, so that you can view only images that fit a certain criteria.</p> <br>

				<p>After you're done, the pictures remain saved in your album so you can revisit pictures anytime you want. You can create as many albums as you want and store your pictures privately online in case you ever switch computers and forget to transfer your photos.</p> <br>
